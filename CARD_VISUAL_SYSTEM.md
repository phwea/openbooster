# Card Visual System - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The card visual system provides **stable, deterministic, set-specific artwork** that evolves through rarity tiers while maintaining unique visual identities for each expansion set.

## ✅ Stability Guarantee

### **Problem Solved**
Cards were re-rendering with different artwork on every hover/interaction, causing visual instability and rapid cycling.

### **Solution**
All procedurally-generated values are **memoized once per card** via `React.useMemo`:
```typescript
const stable = React.useMemo(()=>{
  const r = rng(seed)
  return {
    x1, y1, x2, y2,           // Position values
    brushes: [...],            // Pre-generated brush strokes
    shardLengths: [...],       // Pre-generated shard data
    particles: [...]           // Pre-generated particle data
  }
}, [seed])
```

**Result**: Cards **never change** on hover, scroll, or re-render. Same seed = same artwork, always.

## 🎨 Set-Specific Visual Identity

### **Three Unique Themes**

#### **BASE (Classic)** - `theme: 'classic'`
- **Colors**: Gold `#eac27c` + Orange `#ffb347`
- **Style**: Geometric, traditional, refined elegance
- **Motifs**: Rectangles, frames, gallery presentation, prismatic light
- **Evolution**: Clean → Layered → Ornamental → Gallery → Museum → Prismatic → Ornate → Golden

#### **APEX (Cosmic)** - `theme: 'cosmic'`
- **Colors**: Violet `#8893ff` + Purple `#b388ff`
- **Style**: Space, orbital, ethereal glow
- **Motifs**: Orbs, rings, constellations, auroras, supernovas
- **Evolution**: Floating → Orbital → Stellar → Aurora → Supernova → Cosmic → Celestial

#### **NEO (Speed)** - `theme: 'speed'`
- **Colors**: Cyan `#8df2ff` + Magenta `#ff8dce`
- **Style**: Tech, circuitry, angular motion
- **Motifs**: Lines, circuits, holograms, data streams, energy surges
- **Evolution**: Circuit → Mesh → Hologram → Data → Energy → Speed → Velocity

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/lib/
├── cardArt.tsx           # Main component - routing logic
├── artwork/
│   ├── baseArt.tsx      # BASE/Classic set artwork
│   ├── apexArt.tsx      # APEX/Cosmic set artwork
│   └── neoArt.tsx       # NEO/Speed set artwork
```

### **Modular Architecture Benefits**
✅ Each set's visuals are isolated in separate files  
✅ Easy to add new sets without touching existing code  
✅ Each rarity tier has distinct visual personality per set  
✅ Maintains performance with component-level optimization  
✅ Clear naming convention: `BaseD1`, `ApexS2`, `NeoCROWN`

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Deterministic Seeding**
```typescript
const seed = seedFromId(card.id)  // Hash of card ID
const stable = React.useMemo(()=>{
  const r = rng(seed)
  // Pre-generate ALL random values here
}, [seed])
```

### **Theme Routing**
```typescript
if(rarity==='D1'){
  const props = { w, h, seed, stable, accent: themeAccent, secondary: themeSecondary }
  if(theme==='classic') return <Base.BaseD1 {...props} />
  if(theme==='cosmic') return <Apex.ApexD1 {...props} />
  if(theme==='speed') return <Neo.NeoD1 {...props} />
  return <Base.BaseD1 {...props} />
}
```

### **SVG Features Used**
- `linearGradient` / `radialGradient` for color depth
- `feGaussianBlur` for soft glow effects
- `feComponentTransfer` for enhanced luminosity
- `feOffset` + `feMerge` for emboss effects
- Layered primitives for rich composition

## 🎭 Visual Progression Example

### **BASE Set Evolution (Classic Theme)**
```
D1 → Clean rectangles with soft gradients
D2 → Stepped frames with refined borders
D3 → Concentric circles with golden lens flare
D4 → Diagonal sweep with gold/orange transition
D5 → Ornamental corners with embossed center
S1 → Painterly brushstrokes with gallery frame
S2 → Museum depth with golden highlights
S3 → Prismatic power with refracted light
S4 → Ornate prism with fluid light bands
CROWN → Golden majesty with refined crown and ornaments
```

Each tier **builds on the previous** while introducing new complexity.

## 🎯 Design Principles

### **1. Stability**
- No random values generated during render
- All artwork memoized via seed
- Same card = same visuals, always

### **2. Set Identity**
- Each set has distinct color palette
- Visual motifs align with set theme
- Consistent visual language per set

### **3. Rarity Evolution**
- Lower rarities: minimal, clean
- Mid rarities: structured, refined
- High rarities: ornate, cinematic
- Legendary: ultimate, convergent

### **4. Performance**
- Component-level memoization
- GPU-friendly SVG primitives
- No runtime procedural generation
- Efficient re-render handling

### **5. Creativity**
- Unique artwork per (set × rarity)
- Intentional compositions, not procedural
- Handcrafted feel with code efficiency
- Distinct visual personality per tier

## 📝 Adding New Sets

To add a new set (e.g., "VOID" theme):

1. **Create artwork module**: `src/lib/artwork/voidArt.tsx`
2. **Export components**: `VoidD1`, `VoidD2`, `VoidS1`, etc.
3. **Import in cardArt.tsx**: `import * as Void from './artwork/voidArt'`
4. **Add theme color**: `const themeAccent = theme==='void' ? '#9d4edd' : ...`
5. **Add routing**: `if(theme==='void') return <Void.VoidD1 {...props} />`

No changes needed to existing sets.

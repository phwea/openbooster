# Testing Guide: Cinematic Animation System

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Pack Opening
1. Go to `/catalog` and select a set
2. Click to open a pack
3. Observe the entry animation (stack rises with bounce)
4. Click/tap or press Space/Enter to discard cards

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **A. Basic Motion Flow**
**Expected**: Each click triggers smooth 3-phase animation
1. ✅ **Lift**: Card rises ~14px toward camera (150ms)
2. ✅ **Arc**: Card flies out in curved path (350ms)
3. ✅ **Promote**: Next card rises with overshoot bounce (300ms)
4. ✅ Total time: ~700ms, feels premium and intentional
5. ✅ No jitter between cards

### **B. Rarity-Based VFX**

#### Test D1-D3 (Common)
- Small blue particle burst (8 particles)
- Soft blue energy ring
- No special effects

#### Test D4-D5 (Uncommon)
- ✅ **Foil shimmer** diagonal sweep across card
- Light holographic streak before throw
- Cyan-tinted particle burst

#### Test S1-S3 (Rare)
- ✅ **Energy ring** pulse with pink/cyan color
- 12 particles with shimmer trails
- ✅ **Ambient stage pulse** (background glow for 800ms)
- Particles spread further than common

#### Test S4 (Epic)
- ✅ **Iridescent lens flare** with multi-color rotation
- Purple/magenta energy burst
- Enhanced stage glow
- Ambient pulse with purple tint

#### Test CROWN (Legendary)
- ✅ **Maximum iridescent flare** with gold accent
- Gold energy burst ring
- 12 gold particles with extended trails
- ✅ **Ambient pulse** with golden glow
- Brief lens bloom effect

### **C. Performance**
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Discard 5-10 cards rapidly
4. Stop recording
5. ✅ Check frame rate: Should maintain **60 FPS** on desktop
6. ✅ Look for no layout shifts or reflows during animation
7. ✅ GPU usage should be smooth, no spikes

### **D. Reduced Motion**

#### Browser Setting Test
1. Enable OS reduced motion:
   - **macOS**: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
   - **Windows**: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations
2. Reload the page
3. ✅ Cards should fade out simply (400ms)
4. ✅ No particles, no VFX bursts
5. ✅ No camera tilt or stage effects
6. ✅ Stack still updates cleanly without overshoot

#### CSS Media Query Verification
Open DevTools and add this to test:
```javascript
// Force reduced motion in console
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-motion', 'reduce')
```

### **E. Responsive / Mobile**
1. Open DevTools responsive mode (375x667 iPhone SE)
2. Test touch interactions
3. ✅ Animations should still be smooth at 30+ FPS
4. ✅ Cards scale appropriately
5. ✅ No horizontal overflow

### **F. Keyboard Navigation**
1. Tab to focus the card stack
2. Press **Space** or **Enter** to discard
3. ✅ Animation triggers same as click
4. ✅ Focus remains on stack after discard
5. ✅ Can discard entire pack with keyboard only

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

### Motion Jitter
- ❌ If cards flicker or jump between frames
- ✅ Should be smooth translate3d motion

### VFX Not Showing
- Check console for errors
- Verify `prefersReduced` is false
- Check that rarity rank matches expected tier

### Timing Feels Off
- Verify constants in PackView.tsx:
  ```typescript
  DISCARD_MS = 700
  PROMOTE_MS = 300
  ```
- CSS keyframe percentages should match (21%, 71%, 85%, 100%)

### GPU Performance Issues
- Check if `will-change` is present on animated elements
- Verify `transform: translateZ(0)` forces GPU layer
- Look for excessive repaints in DevTools Rendering panel

## 🎨 Visual Inspection Checklist

### Entry (Before First Card)
- [ ] Stack rises from below with anticipation bounce
- [ ] Light sweep passes across surface once
- [ ] Smooth fade-in, no pop-in

### During Discard
- [ ] Card lifts noticeably before throw
- [ ] Arc path feels natural (not straight line)
- [ ] Card rotates in 3D space (rotateY, rotateZ visible)
- [ ] Motion blur increases as card exits
- [ ] Shadow/lighting responds to movement

### VFX Activation
- [ ] Energy burst appears at start of discard
- [ ] Burst scales and fades over 280ms
- [ ] Foil shimmer (D4-D5) sweeps diagonally
- [ ] Iridescent flare (S4/CROWN) rotates with color shift
- [ ] Particles shoot outward in circle pattern
- [ ] Particle trails fade smoothly

### Stage Response
- [ ] Background glow intensifies during discard
- [ ] Camera shifts subtly (0.8deg tilt)
- [ ] Ambient pulse (S3+) pulses for 800ms
- [ ] No overflow outside stage panel

### Promote
- [ ] Next card rises with overshoot
- [ ] Slight bounce settle at end
- [ ] Brightness pulses during rise
- [ ] Back cards adjust opacity smoothly

## 🔍 Debug Commands

### Force Animation State
```javascript
// In browser console
document.querySelector('.card-stack-item').classList.add('card-discarding')
```

### Check Computed Timings
```javascript
// Get actual animation duration
const card = document.querySelector('.card-discarding')
const anim = getComputedStyle(card).animation
console.log(anim) // Should show 700ms
```

### Measure Frame Rate
```javascript
let lastTime = performance.now()
let frames = 0
function measureFPS() {
  frames++
  const now = performance.now()
  if(now - lastTime >= 1000) {
    console.log('FPS:', frames)
    frames = 0
    lastTime = now
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(measureFPS)
}
measureFPS()
```

### Toggle Motion Mode
```javascript
// Switch between full and reduced
document.querySelector('.stage-canvas').dataset.motion = 'reduce'
// or
document.querySelector('.stage-canvas').dataset.motion = 'full'
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Animation system is working correctly when:

1. ✅ **Smooth 60 FPS** on desktop hardware
2. ✅ **3-phase motion** is clearly visible (lift → arc → promote)
3. ✅ **No jitter** or frame skips between cards
4. ✅ **VFX match rarity** tier automatically
5. ✅ **Reduced motion** works without breaking logic
6. ✅ **Deterministic timing** - no transitionend reliance
7. ✅ **GPU-accelerated** - uses transform/opacity only
8. ✅ **Accessible** - keyboard and screen reader friendly
9. ✅ **Contained** - no overflow outside stage panel
10. ✅ **Feels premium** - tactile, kinetic, rewarding
